I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at [Interactive Robotics Laboratory](https://interactive-robotics.engineering.asu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, [Arizona State University (ASU)](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/){:target="\_blank"} working with [Prof. Heni Ben Amor](https://henibenamor.weebly.com/){:target="\_blank"}, working at the intersection of LLM and Robotics.
Before this, was a Research Scientist at [PARC](https://www.sri.com/research/future-concepts-division/){:target="\_blank"}, part of SRI International (prior Xerox PARC).
I earned my Ph.D. from [Yochan Lab](https://yochan-lab.github.io/home/){:target="\_blank"} under the supervision of [Prof. Subbarao Kambhampati](https://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu){:target="\_blank"} at ASU.
During my Ph.D., I did summer internship as an Applied Scientist Intern in Alexa at Amazon, Pittsburgh (2018 and 2021).

:point_right: Currently, I am looking for **full-time opportunities** in research and engineering roles.

**Research Interest**: LLM Reasoning and Agents, Learning+Planning systems, Neurosymbolic techniques.

##### Research

I am interested in LLM based reasoning and agent behavior, with a focus on enhancing their capabilities through both pre-training and post-training techniques.
With over a decade of research experience in automated reasoning and planning, I have worked on learning-based methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and formal, symbolic approaches including Automated Task Planning with an application in robotics.
My long-term goal is to develop neuro-symbolic systems applied to Robotics that are both data-efficient and capable of operating in dynamic environments with minimal human supervision. These agents/robots will integrate the generalization abilities of LLMs with the structure and reliability of symbolic reasoning, enabling robust decision-making and adaptation in real-world settings.
