This is an example post with videos. It supports local video files.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        Empty Text
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        Empty
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

It does also support embedding videos from different sources. Here are some examples:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        Empty
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        Empty
    </div>
</div>
