title: Open-World AI Agent
description:
  - Designed Hydra framework for domain independent agents working in dynamic environments. Dynamic environment is the one where the assumptions made by the agent during training phase change during the test phase. The agent needs to (1) understand the assumptions, and  (2) accomodate them in its own model. We used the PDDL+ to model these environments and incorporate the changes.
  - This was a DARPA Sail-On project with over 10 teams academic and industry partners, undertaken by PARC, where we were the top performing team. The evaluation was performed by third-party on Angry Birds game, Minecraft based grid environments, and Cartpole 3D versions. We also presented a real-world demonstration where fighter jet trajectories were updated due to changes in the environment.
